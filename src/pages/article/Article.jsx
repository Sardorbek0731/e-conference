          Application of the FILA Table for Enhancing Clinical Thinking in
          Medical Students in the Teaching of Phthisiology
        </h1>

          Abstract: This article analyzes the significance of using the FILA
          table in teaching phthisiology to develop clinical thinking in medical
          students. The FILA table is considered a tool that facilitates a
          deeper understanding of the learning process and enhances students'
          problem-solving skills in clinical settings. This method plays a
          crucial role in shaping clinical analysis skills, developing critical
          thinking and encouraging students to make independent decisions. By
          using the FILA table, students can systematically analyze existing
          information about diseases, deepening their knowledge. Furthermore,
          this tool increases the effectiveness of interactive methods in
          medical education by directing students toward the practical
          application of theoretical knowledge. The study examines the
          effectiveness of this approach, methods of its implementation, and its
          impact on the educational process. The relevance of the FILA table in
          the learning process is emphasized, including its use in practical
          training, its connection with real clinical cases, and the
          opportunities it provides for students to conduct independent
          research. Keywords: phthisiology, clinical thinking, FILA table,
          interactive learning, medical education, innovative pedagogy,
          independent thinking, analytical approach.
